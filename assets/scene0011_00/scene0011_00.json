There should be four chairs in total.\nASSISTANT: Understood. I will bring chair over to table so that all four chairs will be available for additional seating.\nUSER: I'm curious, what's the design purpose of the stainless steel cabinet with a wooden cabinet next to the kitchen cabinets?\nASSISTANT: The stainless steel cabinet with a wooden cabinet is designed for both aesthetic appeal and functionality. The stainless steel provides a durable, easy-to-clean surface and the wooden part offers a warm, natural look as well as additional storage space.\nUSER: Interesting. Can you tell me if the brown upholstered armchair with angled armrests is part of the dining set or is it just for relaxing in the kitchen?\nASSISTANT: The brown upholstered armchair with angled armrests seems to be placed more for relaxation and comfort in the kitchen area, rather than as part of the dining set. It's an inviting spot for someone to sit and enjoy the ambiance or have a casual conversation.\nUSER: Thanks. Could you then move armchair closer to double-hung window for a more comfortable place to read with natural light? (with grounding)",
